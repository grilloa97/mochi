Andi is a recent Oregon State graduate based in Oregon.

During her time as a student, she interned with both the Athletics Department and Printmaking Professor Yuji Hiratsuka. blending digital and traditional mediums to create something that I can't name right now.

I'm an avid comic enthusiast, and hope to someday publish my own stories to share with the world.

I enjoy methodical and repetitive processes - blame hours in the print studio pulling edition after edition and appreciating the small subtle differences each time.

I love greens! I'm definitely one of those gays who loves frogs and snails.

  
I can learn things relatively quickly 

I will always offer to help or pick up slack where needed, I think I'm an ok listener

  
I really like Pok√©mon! that's it that's my whole personality  

enjoys the duality/balance of hand printed media and digital craft

 not in front of a computer, I was often up to my arms in Akua and Gamblin ink

I take my craft very seriously, I don't stand behind a design I don't support

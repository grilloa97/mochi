a graphic designer, ex ski racer, and aspiring comic artist.

enjoys the duality/balance of hand printed media and digital craft

during my time at Oregon State University, I created promotional deliverables for the Athletic Department, supporting teams with game day graphics and celebrations of achievement - while not in front of a computer, I was often up to my arms in Akua and Gamblin ink, editioning traditional prints of my own design, as well as for internationally renowned artists. I was the studio assistant and lab tech to professor Yuji Hiratsuka, awarded the position and accompanying scholarship for printmaking excellence. 

I take my craft very seriously, I don't stand behind a design I don't support

While interface design is the core of my expertise, experience in front-end development and traditional graphic round out my perspective. I have experience managing multi-stakeholder creative processes and am self-motivated but able to adapt to different team structures. Based in Oregon.

I like to think big, but Iâ€™m pragmatic in my day-to-day work and can take fast decisions on what needs to be done in the short term.

Andi is a recent Oregon State graduate based in Oregon.

During her time as a student, she interned with both the Athletics Department and Printmaking Professor Yuji Hiratsuka. blending digital and traditional mediums to create something that I can't name right now.

I'm an avid comic enthusiast, and hope to someday publish my own stories to share with the world.

Though my brain can work faster than my body, I enjoy methodical and repetitive processes - blame hours in the print studio pulling edition after edition and appreciating the small subtle differences each time.

I love greens! I'm definitely one of those gays who loves frogs and snails.

I can be fucking awkward in new environments, please forgive any terrible ice breaker puns I may drop to try and warm up to you, humor is my way of vibe checking

I and eager to please! disappointing people is one of my biggest fears and I haven't brought that up with my therapist yet, so please be patient with me because I will run off to cry in the bathroom if I think you're not happy with me  
I also have ADHD and will forget shit if I don't write it down, it also takes me a lot of thinking before I actually start a project, which isn't great, so I try to not get too invested into things because if they're too important in my brain, I won't do them

These have all been pretty negative things so far but it's really difficult for me to think of a reason why people would want to hire me, my strengths are that I work fast but doing so is often through sheer over exertion and fear of deadlines, I have mild perfectionist tendencies, and I want to make sure I'm happy with what I make before I let anyone else see it - because of that positive feedback doesn't really help me!! because I know you're lying :)))  
I can learn things relatively quickly because of my hyper fixative/obsessive tendencies, but I usually pair learning something new with a project so that may make me take longer to finish it

I'm terrible at communicating!! I will not ask for help you will have to repeatedly tell me, I'm sorry, fear of failure and all and asking for help = failing in my brain 

My therapist said I'm a decently pleasant person I guess

I will always offer to help or pick up slack where needed, I think I'm an ok listener, or I can at least pretend that I make people feel heard  
I can get a little bit competitive but I guess that's not an inherently bad thing in moderation?

Sometimes I worry that there's no more room in my brain for things  
But now I wonder if any of these are actually my traits or things I've just learned to parrot from others  
I find myself to be somewhat of a lonely person, I do a lot of listening but am rarely heard myself, I try to pay such close attention to others but no one seems to notice me,   
I really like Pok√©mon! that's it that's my whole personality  

a graphic designer, ex ski racer, and aspiring comic artist.

enjoys the duality/balance of hand printed media and digital craft

during my time at Oregon State University, I created promotional deliverables for the Athletic Department, supporting teams with game day graphics and celebrations of achievement - while not in front of a computer, I was often up to my arms in Akua and Gamblin ink, editioning traditional prints of my own design, as well as for internationally renowned artists. I was the studio assistant and lab tech to professor Yuji Hiratsuka, awarded the position and accompanying scholarship for printmaking excellence.

I take my craft very seriously, I don't stand behind a design I don't support
